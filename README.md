# SQL A/B Test Metrics

**TL;DR:** DuckDB SQL to compute CTR lift, daily CTR, and D1 retention for a synthetic A/B test â€” with a z-test and p-value.

## Whatâ€™s inside
- Problem: Measure whether variant **B** improves click-through rate (CTR) vs **A** and impact on D1 retention.
- Approach: Pure SQL over CSVs (DuckDB). Includes sanity checks, lift calc, and a two-sided z-test.
- Data: Synthetic CSVs in `data/` (generated by `generate_data.py`).
- Result: On this seed, B shows **ðŸ’¬ your absolute/relative lift** with **p=ðŸ’¬** (two-sided).

## How to run
```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python generate_data.py     # optional if you want fresh data
duckdb -c ".read queries.sql"
